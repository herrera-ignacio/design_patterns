* Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate. Thus, we can pass around a decorated object in place of the original (wrapped) object.
* You can use one or more decorators to wrap an object.
* The decorator adds its own behavior either before and/or after delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job.
* Objects can be decorated at any time, so we can decorate objects dynamically at runtime with as many decorators as we like.
