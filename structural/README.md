# Structural Patterns

## Definition

> Structural patterns are concerned with __how classes and objects are composed to form larger structurals__.

Structural _class_ patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. The result is a class that combines the properties of its parent classes.

Structural _object_ patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functioanlity. The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.

### Discussion on Structural Patterns

Structural patterns rely on same small set of language mechanisms for structuring code and objects: single and multiple inheritance for class-based patterns, and object composition for object patterns.
