# Structural Patterns

Concern with _how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures_.

> Structural _class_ patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. The
result is a class that combines the properties of its parent classes.

This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class libraries work together.

> Structural _object_ patterns describe way to compose objects to realize new functionality.

The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is
impossible with static class composition.
