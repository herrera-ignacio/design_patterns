# Design Patterns

### :pushpin: Description

Theory and practical examples of design patterns in multiple programming languages (C++, Javascript and Python).

I want to address the following points in this project:
* What are design patterns and why are they important?
* Real-life working examples

If you are unfamiliar with object-oriented fundamentals or
you would like a quick refresh of some concepts as Polymorphism, Inheritance
and Composition, you will find helpful checking the first summary

* [Object-oriented programming must know concepts!](./oop-fundamentals/README.md)
    * Basics (Class, Interface, Type, etc...)
    * 4 pillars of oop (Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)
    * Intermediate (Composition and delegation, trade-offs with inheritance)
    * Principles of object-oriented design

* [Introduction](./introduction.md)
    * What is a Design Pattern?
    * Catalog of Design Patterns
    * How design patterns solve design problems

### :bangbang: Status

This is work in progress, I'm planning to finish implementing
examples for all the design patterns in GoF book using JavaScript and then give similar examples with C++ or C#.
