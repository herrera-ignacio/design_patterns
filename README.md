# Design Patterns

### :pushpin: Description

Theory and practical examples of design patterns in multiple programming languages (C++, Javascript and Python).

I want to address the following points in this project:
* What are design patterns and why are they important?
* Real-life working examples

### :books: Bibliography

* :closed_book: [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

### :bangbang: Status

This is work in progress, I'm planning to finish implementing
examples for all the design patterns in GoF book using C++, and then
give similar examples with Javascript and Python.
