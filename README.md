# Design Patterns

### :pushpin: Description

Theory and practical examples of design patterns in multiple programming languages (C++, Javascript and Python).

I want to address the following points in this project:
* What are design patterns and why are they important?
* Real-life working examples

### :books: Bibliography

* :closed_book: [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

| Creational       	| Structural 	| Behavioral 	|
|------------------	|------------	|------------	|
| Abstract Factory 	| WIP        	| WIP        	|
| Builder          	|            	|            	|

If you are unfamiliar with object-oriented fundamentals or
you would like a quick refresh of some concepts as Polymorphism, Inheritance
and Composition, you will find helpful the following summary:

* [Introduction](./introduction.md)
    * What is a Design Pattern?
    * Catalog of Design Patterns
    * How design patterns solve design problems
    * How to select a design pattern
    * How to use a design pattern

	* Abstract Factory
	* Builder
	* Factory Method
	* Prototype
	* Singleton

### :bangbang: Status

This is work in progress, I'm planning to finish implementing
examples for all the design patterns in GoF book using C++, and then
give similar examples with Javascript and Python.
