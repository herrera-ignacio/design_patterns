# Design Patterns

### :pushpin: Description

Theory and practical examples of design patterns in multiple programming languages (C++, Javascript and Python).

I want to address the following points in this project:
* What are design patterns and why are they important?
* Real-life working examples

### :books: Bibliography

* :closed_book: [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

If you are unfamiliar with object-oriented fundamentals or
you would like a quick refresh of some concepts as Polymorphism, Inheritance
and Composition, you will find helpful checking the first summary

* [Object-oriented programming must know concepts!](./oop-fundamentals/README.md)
    * Basics (Class, Interface, Type, etc...)
    * 4 pillars of oop (Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)
    * Intermediate (Composition and delegation, trade-offs with inheritance)
    * Principles of object-oriented design

* [Introduction](./introduction.md)
    * What is a Design Pattern?
    * Catalog of Design Patterns
    * How design patterns solve design problems
    * How to select a design pattern
    * How to use a design pattern
    

* [Creational Patterns](./creational/creational-patterns.md)
	* Abstract Factory
	* Builder
	* Factory Method
	* Prototype
	* Singleton
	
* [Structural Patterns](./structural/structural-patterns.md)
    * Adapter (or Wrapper)
    * Bridge  (or Handle/Body)
	* Composite
    * Decorator (or Wrapper)
    * Flyweight

### :bangbang: Status

This is work in progress, I'm planning to finish implementing
examples for all the design patterns in GoF book using JavaScript and then give similar examples with C++ or C#.
